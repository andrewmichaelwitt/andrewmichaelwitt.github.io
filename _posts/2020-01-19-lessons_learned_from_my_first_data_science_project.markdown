As I started my first Data Science Project I quickly came to some fast realizations. This is a dive into what those realizations were and what I plan to do about them.

I started my first Data Science Project with grandeose expectations. What I didnt realize was the number of roadblocks I would eventually run into.

I discovered first that I started going with thoughts about questions on viability for Microsoft, which I enentually realized was outside the scope of our assignment as a company hired by them. I realized that I really needed to look just at the data itself and industry information vs conceptual questions about what is a good idea for Microsoft to do in the first place. 

Next I discovered the data in the project as it was given to us was in a far worse state then I realized or expected. This is what forced me to drastically alter my direction on which problems to solve and how to go about doing them. 

Ultimately I learned alot on this first Project, but the thing I'm keeping in mind is that it's only uphill from here and I'm excited about the journey ahead.
